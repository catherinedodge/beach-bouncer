[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) provide a simple way to make a
website using
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
[git](https://git-scm.com). With [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), you just write things in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[GitHub](https://github.com) hosts the site for you, and you just push
material to your GitHub repository with `git add`, `git commit`, and
`git push`.

This is a placeholder while I'm in the process of building this tool out. 

So far I have code to:

- Write data on when a given lot closes to DynamoDB

TODOs include:
- Pull historical data from Twitter
- Use the historical data to generate predictions
- Setup a twitter bot to post the predictions for that day
- Measure how well our predictions compare to the posted times
